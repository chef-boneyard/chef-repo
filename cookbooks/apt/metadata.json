There are recipes for managing the apt-cacher-ng caching proxy and proxy clients. It also includes a LWRP for managing APT repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list.d as well as an LWRP for pinning packages via /etc/apt/preferences.d.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n**Version 2.0.0+ of this cookbook requires Chef 11.0.0 or later**. If your Chef version is earlier than 11.0.0, use version 1.10.0 of this cookbook.\n\nVersion 1.8.2 to 1.10.0 of this cookbook requires **Chef 10.16.4** or later.\n\nIf your Chef version is earlier than 10.16.4, use version 1.7.0 of this cookbook.\n\n### Platform\nPlease refer to the [TESTING file](TESTING.md) to see the currently (and passing) tested platforms. The release was tested on:\n\n* Ubuntu 10.04\n* Ubuntu 12.04\n* Ubuntu 13.04\n* Debian 7.1\n* Debian 6.0 (have with manual testing)\n\nMay work with or without modification on other Debian derivatives.\n\n\n-------\n### default\nThis recipe installs the `update-notifier-common` package to provide the timestamp file used to only run `apt-get update` if the cache is more than one day old.\n\nThis recipe should appear first in the run list of Debian or Ubuntu nodes to ensure that the package cache is up to date before managing any `package` resources with Chef.\n\nThis recipe also sets up a local cache directory for preseeding packages.\n\n**Including the default recipe on a node that does not support apt (such as Windows) results in a noop.**\n\n### cacher-client\nConfigures the node to use the `apt-cacher-ng` server as a client.\n\n#### Bypassing the cache\nOccasionally you may come across repositories that do not play nicely when the node is using an `apt-cacher-ng` server. You can configure `cacher-client` to bypass the server and connect directly to the repository with the `cache_bypass` attribute.\n\nTo do this, you need to override the `cache_bypass` attribute with an array of repositories, with each array key as the repository URL and value as the protocol to use:\n\n```json\n{\n    ...,\n    'apt': {\n        ...,\n        'cache_bypass': {\n            URL: PROTOCOL\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor example, to prevent caching and directly connect to the repository at `download.oracle.com` via http:\n\n```json\n{\n    'apt': {\n        'cache_bypass': {\n            'download.oracle.com': 'http'\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### cacher-ng\nInstalls the `apt-cacher-ng` package and service so the system can provide APT caching. You can check the usage report at http://{hostname}:3142/acng-report.html.\n\nIf you wish to help the `cacher-ng` recipe seed itself, you must now explicitly include the `cacher-client` recipe in your run list **after** `cacher-ng` or you will block your ability to install any packages (ie. `apt-cacher-ng`).\n\n\nAttributes\n----------\n* `['apt']['cacher_ipaddress']` - use a cacher server (or standard proxy server) not available via search\n* `['apt']['cacher_interface]` - interface to connect to the cacher-ng service, no default.\n* `['apt']['cacher_port']` - port for the cacher-ng service (either client or server), default is '3142'\n* `['apt']['cacher_dir']` - directory used by cacher-ng service, default is '/var/cache/apt-cacher-ng'\n* `['apt']['cacher-client']['restrict_environment']` - restrict your node to using the `apt-cacher-ng` server in your Environment, default is 'false'\n* `['apt']['compiletime']` - force the `cacher-client` recipe to run before other recipes. It forces apt to use the proxy before other recipes run. Useful if your nodes have limited access to public apt repositories. This is overridden if the `cacher-ng` recipe is in your run list. Default is 'false'\n* `['apt']['compile_time_update']` - force the default recipe to run `apt-get update` at compile time.\n* `['apt']['cache_bypass']` - array of URLs to bypass the cache. Accepts the URL and protocol to  fetch directly from the remote repository and not attempt to cache\n* `['apt']['periodic_update_min_delay']` - minimum delay (in seconds) beetween two actual executions of `apt-get update` by the `execute[apt-get-update-periodic]` resource, default is '86400' (24 hours)\n\nLibraries\n---------\nThere is an `interface_ipaddress` method that returns the IP address for a particular host and interface, used by the `cacher-client` recipe. To enable it on the server use the `['apt']['cacher_interface']` attribute.\n\nResources/Providers\n-------------------\n### `apt_repository`\nThis LWRP provides an easy way to manage additional APT repositories. Adding a new repository will notify running the `execute[apt-get-update]` resource immediately.\n\n#### Actions\n- :add: creates a repository file and builds the repository listing (default)\n- :remove: removes the repository file\n\n#### Attribute Parameters\n- repo_name: name attribute. The name of the channel to discover\n- uri: the base of the Debian distribution\n- distribution: this is usually your release's codename...ie something like `karmic`, `lucid` or `maverick`\n- components: package groupings... when in doubt use `main`\n- arch: constrain package to a particular arch like `i386`, `amd64` or even `armhf` or `powerpc`. Defaults to nil.\n- trusted: treat all packages from this repository as authenticated regardless of signature\n- deb_src: whether or not to add the repository as a source repo as well - value can be `true` or `false`, default `false`.\n- keyserver: the GPG keyserver where the key for the repo should be retrieved\n- key: if a `keyserver` is provided, this is assumed to be the fingerprint, otherwise it can be either the URI to the GPG key for the repo, or a cookbook_file.\n- key_proxy: if set, pass the specified proxy via `http-proxy=` to GPG.\n- cookbook: if key should be a cookbook_file, specify a cookbook where the key is located for files/default. Defaults to nil, so it will use the cookbook where the resource is used.\n\n#### Examples\n\nAdd the Zenoss repo:\n\n```ruby\napt_repository 'zenoss' do\n  uri        'http://dev.zenoss.org/deb'\n  components ['main', 'stable']\nend\n```\n\nAdd the Nginx PPA, autodetect the key and repository url:\n\n```ruby\napt_repository 'nginx-php' do\n  uri          'ppa:nginx/stable'\n  distribution node['lsb']['codename']\nend\n```\n\nAdd the Nginx PPA, grab the key from the keyserver, and add source repo:\n\n```ruby\napt_repository 'nginx-php' do\n  uri          'http://ppa.launchpad.net/nginx/php5/ubuntu'\n  distribution node['lsb']['codename']\n  components   ['main']\n  keyserver    'keyserver.ubuntu.com'\n  key          'C300EE8C'\n  deb_src      true\nend\n```\n\nAdd the Cloudera Repo of CDH4 packages for Ubuntu 12.04 on AMD64:\n\n```ruby\napt_repository 'cloudera' do\n  uri          'http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh4/ubuntu/precise/amd64/cdh'\n  arch         'amd64'\n  distribution 'precise-cdh4'\n  components   ['contrib']\n  key          'http://archive.cloudera.com/debian/archive.key'\nend\n```\n\nRemove Zenoss repo:\n\n```ruby\napt_repository 'zenoss' do\n  action :remove\nend\n```\n\n### `apt_preference`\nThis LWRP provides an easy way to pin packages in /etc/apt/preferences.d. Although apt-pinning is quite helpful from time to time please note that Debian does not encourage its use without thorough consideration.\n\nFurther information regarding apt-pinning is available via http://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences.\n\n#### Actions\n- :add: creates a preferences file under /etc/apt/preferences.d\n- :remove: Removes the file, therefore unpin the package\n\n#### Attribute Parameters\n- package_name: name attribute. The name of the package\n- glob: Pin by glob() expression or regexp surrounded by /.\n- pin: The package version/repository to pin\n- pin_priority: The pinning priority aka \"the highest package version wins\"\n\n#### Examples\nPin libmysqlclient16 to version 5.1.49-3:\n\n```ruby\napt_preference 'libmysqlclient16' do\n  pin          'version 5.1.49-3'\n  pin_priority '700'\nend\n```\n\nUnpin libmysqlclient16:\n\n```ruby\napt_preference 'libmysqlclient16' do\n  action :remove\nend\n```\n\nPin all packages from dotdeb.org:\n\n```ruby\napt_preference 'dotdeb' do\n  glob         '*'\n  pin          'origin packages.dotdeb.org'\n  pin_priority '700'\nend\n```\n\n\nUsage\n-----\nPut `recipe[apt]` first in the run list. If you have other recipes that you want to use to configure how apt behaves, like new sources, notify the execute resource to run, e.g.:\n\n```ruby\ntemplate '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/my_apt_sources.list' do\n  notifies :run, 'execute[apt-get update]', :immediately\nend\n```\n\nThe above will run during execution phase since it is a normal template resource, and should appear before other package resources that need the sources in the template.\n\nPut `recipe[apt::cacher-ng]` in the run_list for a server to provide APT caching and add `recipe[apt::cacher-client]` on the rest of the Debian-based nodes to take advantage of the caching server.\n\nIf you want to cleanup unused packages, there is also the `apt-get autoclean` and `apt-get autoremove` resources provided for automated cleanup.\n\n\nLicense & Authors\n-----------------\n- Author:: Joshua Timberman (joshua@opscode.com)\n- Author:: Matt Ray (matt@opscode.com)\n- Author:: Seth Chisamore (schisamo@opscode.com)\n\n```text\nCopyright 2009-2013, Opscode, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n",
