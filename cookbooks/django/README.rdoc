= DESCRIPTION:

Installs Python Django package and sets up Apache2 to serve a django application.

= REQUIREMENTS:

Opscode cookbooks, http://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master:

* python
* apache2

= ATTRIBUTES:

node[:django][:web_server] - set whether to use mod_python or mod_wsgi. Defaults to mod_wsgi because that is the recommended web server strategy to use by the Django creator.

= USAGE:

Create the django application using the Apache2 cookbook's web_app define. Normally this would be done in a site-cookbook.

  web_app "mysite" do
    docroot "/srv/mysite"
    template "mysite.conf.erb"
  end

Create the template, 'mysite.conf.erb' within the site-cookbook. Make sure the django settings are correct. The web_app define copies the template over and enables it as an apache2 site.

The Opscode "application" cookbook is going to grow the ability to deploy a Django application from a source repository. This cookbook will be used to get the Django and Apache software installed and ready.
