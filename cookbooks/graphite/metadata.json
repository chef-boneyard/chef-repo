You'll want at\nleast one monitor node (i.e. recipe[ganglia]) node to be running\nto use it.\n\n= CAVEATS:\n\nI didn't see an easy way to set Graphite's credentials easily.\nI set those to root/root with an email address going no where.\n\nShips with two default schemas, stats.* (for Etsy's statsd) and a\ncatchall that matches anything. The catchall retains minutely data for\n13 months, as in the default config. stats retains data every 10 seconds\nfor 6 hours, every minute for a week, and every 10 minutes for 5 years.\n",
