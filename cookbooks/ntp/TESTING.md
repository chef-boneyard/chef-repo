This cookbook uses a variety of testing components:

- Unit tests: [ChefSpec](https://github.com/acrmp/chefspec)
- Integration tests: [Test Kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen)
- Chef Style lints: [Foodcritic](https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic)
- Ruby Style lints: [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)


Prerequisites
-------------
To develop on this cookbook, you must have a sane Ruby 1.9+ environment. Given the nature of this installation process (and it's variance across multiple operating systems), we will leave this installation process to the user.

You must also have `bundler` installed:

    $ gem install bundler

You must also have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed:

- [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com)
- [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org)

Once installed, you must install the `vagrant-berkshelf` plugin:

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf


Development
-----------
1. Clone the git repository from GitHub:

    $ git clone git@github.com:opscode-cookbooks/COOKBOOK.git

2. Install the dependencies using bundler:

    $ bundle install

3. Create a branch for your changes:

    $ git checkout -b my_bug_fix

4. Make any changes
5. Write tests to support those changes. It is highly recommended you write both unit and integration tests.
6. Run the tests:

    - `bundle exec rake`
    - `bundle exec rake kitchen`

7. Assuming the tests pass, open a Pull Request on GitHub
8. Open a JIRA ticket for this component, linking the JIRA ticket to the Pull Request and visa versa.
9. Mark the JIRA ticket as "Fix Provided"
