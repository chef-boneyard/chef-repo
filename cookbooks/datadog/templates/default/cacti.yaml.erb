    # files that contain the metrics tracked in Cacti.

    # The `rrd_path` will probably be '/var/lib/cacti/rra' on Ubuntu
    # or '/var/www/html/cacti/rra' on any other machines.

    # The `rrd_whitelist` is a path to a text file that has a list of patterns,
    # one per line, that should be fetched. If no whitelist is specified, all
    # metrics will be fetched.
